Longest Repeating Substring With Replacement
You are given a string s consisting of only uppercase english characters and an integer k. You can choose up to k characters of the string and replace them with any other uppercase English character.

After performing at most k replacements, return the length of the longest substring which contains only one distinct character.

Example 1:

Input: s = "XYYX", k = 2

Output: 4
Explanation: Either replace the 'X's with 'Y's, or replace the 'Y's with 'X's.

Example 2:

Input: s = "AAABABB", k = 1

Output: 5
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
0 <= k <= s.length
